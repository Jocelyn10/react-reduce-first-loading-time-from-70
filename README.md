We create an example to explain : How to Reduce React App Loading Time By 70%

The major cause for this issue is adding too many components into a single bundle file, so the loading of that bundle file might take more time. To avoid this kind of issue, we need to structure our components in an optimized way. To solve this react itself has a native solution, which is code-splitting and lazy loading. Which allows splitting bundle files into a smaller size.
